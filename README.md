# ZimCom

ZimCom is primarily a voice software like Teamspeak or Discord. It is designed for small communities and can be self-hosted.

ZimCom stands out thanks to its simple configuration and setup. Both the server and client are written in C# with .NET and can be configured via JSON files.

All that is required for the server is port forwarding, and the client can be run without installation.
All settings and logs are stored uniformly in the user's roaming folder.
